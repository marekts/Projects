In the project I use dataset which contains 27305 photo (48x48) with people of different age, gender an ethnic group. My aim is buil model to recognise who is portrayed on the photo. 

For this task I will use Keras for building models based on convolutional neural networs which suit well for image recognition. 

I will construct three model and use three targets: 

- Age
- Gender
- Ethnicity

After training models I'm going to create a function which will predict these three parameters by photo.
