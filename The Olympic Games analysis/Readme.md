In this project my aim is practising skills in python's libraries pandas and matplotlib and present some interest facts and statistics about the history of The Olympic Games. <br>
I will use dataset from Kaggle. This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.  

Dataset consists from two parts: main part with all data and second part, which includes data about country. I will merge these two parts in one data frame. 

In this notebook I highlighted three parts:
  - **Age**. In this part I present different information about age: how had been changing mean, min, max age through the time, in which sport the most oldest and youngest participants etc. 
  - **Medals**. Which country and which sportsman got the most medals? In which sports?
  - **Sports**. Some information about different kinds of sports, as which sports were always in the Olympic Games and which is the new etc.
