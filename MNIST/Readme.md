MNIST is classic dataset of handwritten digits. It contains 70000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9. <br>
I will start my acquaintance with computer vision and image recognition from this dataset. <br>

I used a few approach:

  - [x] Multilayer perceptron
  - [x] CNN
  
Accuracy for CNN is **~99.3%** <br>
CNN performed a better result than MLP and it's no surprise, because CNN known by image recognition.
