I'm interesting in machine learning and data science and in this repository I will follow my progress in this field. <br>

In my projects I use **Python** and libraries **numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, keras**. <br>

| Project | Description | Tools | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Facial recognition | Prediction age, gender and ethnicity by face image| Keras, CNN | Age, MAE: 5.7 <br>  Gender, Acc: ~91% <br>  Ethnicity, Acc ~81% |
| [ Books recommendation ](https://github.com/marekts/Projects/blob/master/Books%20recommendation/User-based.ipynb) | User-based recommender system | Pandas | | 
| [ Recognition of artists ](https://github.com/marekts/Projects/blob/master/Arts/artist%20classification.ipynb) | Classification artist by painting | Keras, transfer learning | Acc: ~63% | 
| [ MNIST ](https://github.com/marekts/Projects/tree/master/MNIST) | Recognise handwritten digits | Keras, MLP, CNN | Acc: ~99.6%|
| [ Titanic ](https://github.com/marekts/Projects/tree/master/Titanic) | Prediction which passengers survived after disaster | NumPy, Pandas, ScikitLearn | Acc: ~80% |
| [ Real estate price prediction ](https://github.com/marekts/Projects/tree/master/Real%20estate%20price%20prediction) | Prediction houses sale prices | NumPy, Pandas, ScikitLearn, XGBoost | RMSLE: 0.12089 |
| [ The Olympic Games analysis ](https://github.com/marekts/Projects/tree/master/The%20Olympic%20Games%20analysis) | Research of the history of the Olympic Games | NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib | | 


Mainly I'm learning from books and online courses.

Some of books I studied:
  - "Python crash course" by Eric Matthes 
  - "Python for data analysis" by Wes McKinney 
  - "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron

Some of courses I finished:
  - [Cognitive Class: Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/102f184c-22f1-4381-98a0-5123658023d8/linked_in_profile)
  - DataWorkshop: Practical Machine Learning
  - [Udemy: The DataScience Course 2020](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-480c5011-7a7a-4f45-b1cd-d7359928c934/) 
  - [Cognitive Class: Machine Learning with Python](https://courses.cognitiveclass.ai/certificates/c44b1581dde04f88b3bcf70480467a42)

I have been taking part in a few competitions from Kaggle. Also I use this platform for looking for inspiration and datasets.
